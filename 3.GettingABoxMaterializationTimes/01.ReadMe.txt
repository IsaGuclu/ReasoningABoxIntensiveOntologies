This folder (Getting ABox Materialization Times) contains the resources used in experiments and information about how to re-make the experiments.

The java files (TimeHarvester.java) are the resources to make experiments. To make experimenting simpler, all dependencies are included in the Executable Jars (ELK.0.4.3, JFaCT.1.2.4, TrOWL.1.5) with just getting the parameter of the address of the ontology file to be processed by TimeHarvester.java.

Shell scripts (Iterate....sh) are the scripts to run the experiments sequentially. The timeout of every ontology processing is set to 30 MINUTES in our experiments. There are 2 main training datasets, 1941 ontology set (dataset-1) and 3858 ontology set (dataset-2) which includes the 356 ontologies (which have an ABox intensity >= 5.0) in 1941 dataset with newly produced ontologies using random subsets of these 1941 ontologies. 
In these scripts, researcher will just need to update the folder address of the ontologies accordingly.

Executable Jars (ELK.0.4.3, JFaCT.1.2.4, TrOWL.1.5) are produced just by adding [TimeHarvester.java] and combining all dependencies in one jar.
 
* All experiments about measuring metrics and getting execution times are made on Java SE 7 Update 121 with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS OS. The processor of the desktop computer was "Intel® Core™ i5-3470 CPU @ 3.20GHz × 4". The machine had 16 GB RAM (2 x  8192 MB DDR3 1600 MHz). 

* R Environment: R version 3.3.1 (2016-06-21), Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit), OS: Windows 8.1 (64-bit), Java 7 Update 80 (64-bit)
