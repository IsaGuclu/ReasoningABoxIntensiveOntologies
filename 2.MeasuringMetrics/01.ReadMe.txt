This folder (Measuring Metrics) contains the executable jars (Metrics92.jar and OWL2Predictions.jar) and scripts to call them for measuring 92 Metrics (by Kang et al.) and 51 Metrics propose by Pan et al.
(The source code of "Measuring 51 Metrics" can be reached from http://sid.cps.unizar.es/projects/OWL2Predictions/IJSWIS17/)
(As the source code of "Measuring 92 Metrics" is not our contribution, we just put the executable jar used in measuring and recommend researchers to refer to http://users.monash.edu/~yli/metrics_reg/ for more details about "Measuring 92 Metrics".)

In these scripts (Measure....sh), researcher will just need to update the folder address of the ontologies accordingly.
