This folder (CreatingPredictionModels) contains R-Scripts, raw data prepared to be processed by R Environment, results we obtained in our experiments and analysis we made using these experiment results.
We prefered to use MS Excel format for introducing data to R Environment, extracting prediction (or selection) results and making analysis graphically because of its simplicity.

There are 3 folder that contain experimental resources:
a. 0.FeatureSelectionByBoruta: In this folder, resources about feature selection by Boruta and its results can be found.
b. 1.AssessingWith10-foldCrossValidation: In this folder, experiment results validated by 10-fold Cross Validation can be found with all variables and variables selected by Boruta.
c. 2.AssessingWith80-20SeparatedData: In this folder, experiment results validated by 80%-20% Separation can be found with all variables and variables selected by Boruta.

The "Comparison.xlsx" contains the summary and visualization of all results that are also used in the work of Pan et al.
